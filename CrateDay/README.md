# CrateDay

A script written in Python which calculates how many days until the next Crate Day.
This is intended to run on a web server - the result is printed as html.
The index.php should be modified to point to cgi-bin/crateday.pl

Crate Day is a 'holiday' in New Zealand where to mark the arrival of summer, we drink a crate of beer on the first Saturday of December.
