# Blockchain

I wanted to learn a little more about how cryptocurrencies work, so I wrote a basic blockchain following Daniel van Flymen's [excellent guide](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)

I learnt a few new things doing this and it was a lot of fun to write.
