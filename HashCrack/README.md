# HashCrack
This is a simple program I wrote while learning python (after about a month of learning). It is not finished and I don't know if I will finish it.
It cracks hashes in a text file. It supports brute force and dictionary attacks. It does MD5, SHA1, and SHA2.
It was written for the purpose of learning and is not intended to be used as a reliable password cracking tool.
