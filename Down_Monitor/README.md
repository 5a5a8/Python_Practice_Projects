# Down Monitor
A program written to monitor the status of websites.
Any response status other than OK is considered 'down'.

Domains can be added in the domains.txt file. 

The settings can be found near the top of the downmonitor.py
When configured correctly it will notify a specified email address when a domain goes down for more than the specified amount of time.
